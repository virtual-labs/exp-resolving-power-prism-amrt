## Assignment


<ol>
  <li>
    Describe the steps involved in aligning the spectrometer and positioning the prism in the virtual lab setup. How do the slit focus and slit width controls affect the visibility and sharpness of spectral lines in the telescope view?
  </li>

  <li>
    In the spectrometer experiment, determine the main scale and vernier scale readings of Vernier 1 and Vernier 2. Calculate the corresponding angle of observation. Clearly explain the method you use for reading and interpreting vernier scales.
  </li>

  <li>
    Calculate the resolving power for yellow and blue lines.
  </li>

  <li>
    Calculate the resolving power for red and blue lines.
  </li>

  <li>
    Define the resolving power of a prism. Using the formula
    <strong>R = λ / Δλ</strong>, explain the significance of each term.
    In the context of this virtual experiment, what physical phenomenon allows the spectrometer to resolve closely spaced spectral lines?
  </li>
