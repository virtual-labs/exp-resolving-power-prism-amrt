Spectrometer, prism, prism clamp, mercury vapour lamp, lens.


### Controls
#### Switches
- **Switch On/Off Light** : Used to switch on/off the light.
- **Place Prism/Remove Prism** : This switch used to place the prism on the prism table or remove prism from the prism table.

#### Slider
- **Slit focus** : This slider used to focus the slit while looking through telescope.
- **Slit width** : Using this slider, width of the slit can be adjusted.
- **Telescope**: Using this slider one can move the telescope from its position.
- **Vernier Table**: Vernier table can be rotate using this slider.
#### Fine Angle adjustment
- **Telescope**: This is used to fine adjust the telescope.
- **Vernier Table**: Using this slider , we can rotate fine angle.
#### Measurements
- Here we get the zoomed view of vernier I and II by placing mouse pointer over it.


## Procedure

### Preliminary adjustments:
#### Performing simulator

<ul>
	<li>Focus Telescope on distant object.</li>
	<li>When focus is correct, start button is activated. Then click Start button.</li>
	<li>Switch on the light by clicking Switch On Light button.</li>
	<li>Focus the slit using Slit focus slider.</li>
	<li>Adjust the slit width using Slit width slider.</li>
	<li>Coincide the slit with cross wire in the telescope.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

####  Performing Real Lab:

<ol>
	<li>Turn the telescope towards the white wall or screen and looking through eye-piece, adjust its position till the cross wires are clearly seen.</li>
	<li>Turn the telescope towards window, focus the telescope to a long distant object.</li>
	<li>Place the telescope parallel to collimator.</li>
	<li>Place the collimator directed towards sodium vapor lamb. Switch on the lamp.</li>
	<li>Focus collimator slit using collimator focusing adjustment.</li>
	<li>Adjust the collimator slit width.</li>
	<li>Place prism table, note that the surface of the table is just below the level of telescope and collimator.</li>
	<li>Place spirit level on prism table. Adjust the base leveling screw till the bubble come at the centre of spirit level.</li>
	<li>Clamp the prism holder.</li>
	<li>Clamp the prism in which the sharp edge is facing towards the collimator, and base of the prism is at the clamp.</li>
</ol>

### Least Count of Spectrometer

One main scale division (N)  =................minute

Number of divisions on vernier (v) = ................

L.C    = N/v = .......................minute

### To determine the Angle of minimum deviation:
 

### Direct method
 
####  Performing simulator

<ul>
	<li>Rotate prism table so as to get the refracted light through the prism.</li>
	<li>Make the slit coincide with telescope cross wire.</li>
	<li>Slowly rotate the vernier table by using vernier fine adjusting slider.</li>
	<li>Note the position where the slit is stationary for some moment.</li>
	<li>Using telescope fine adjusting slider, make coincide the slit with cross wire.</li>
</ul>

####   Performing Real Lab
<ol>
	<li>Rotate the prism table so that the light from the collimator falling on one of the face of the prism and emerges through the other face.</li>
	<li>The telescope is turned to view the refracted image of the slit on the other face.</li>
	<li>The vernier table is slowly turned in such a direction that the image of slit is move directed towards the directed ray; ie., &nbsp;in the direction of decreasing angle of deviation.</li>
	<li>It will be found that at a certain position, the image is stationary for some moment. Vernier table is fixed at the position where the image remains stationary.</li>
	<li>Note the readings on main scale and vernier scale.</li>
	<li>Carefully remove the prism from the prism table.</li>
	<li>Turn the telescope parallel to collimator, and note the direct ray readings.</li>
	<li>Find the difference between the direct ray readings and deviated readings. This angle is called angle of minimum deviation (D).</li>
</ol>

### To determine the Resolving power of prism 

<ol>
	<li>Rotate the vernier table so as to fall the light from the collimator to one face of the prism and emerged through another face. (refer the given figure ).</li>
	<li>The emerged ray has different colors.</li>
	<li>Turn the telescope to each color, and note the readings for different colors.</li>
	<li>Remove the prism, hence note direct ray reading.</li>
	<li>Find the angle of minimum deviation for different color.(Say ,violet, blue, green, yellow).</li>
	<li>Find the refractive index for these colors. Using equation <strong>(1).</strong></li>
	<li>Resolving power for yellow and blue</li>
</ol>

$$w=\frac{n_{b}-n_{y}}{n-1}$$


Where $n_{b}$ and $n_{y}$  are the refractive index of blue and yellow, and 

$$n=\frac{n_{b}+n_{y}}{2}$$

Refractive index for the line ________ n1 =  

Refractive index for the line ________ n2 =

Average refractive index $n=\frac{n1+n2}{2}$

Resolving power for ______ and ______ line $ω =\frac{n2-n1}{n-1}$ = 

##  Result:

Angle of the Prism	=……………………………….Degrees<br><br> Angle of minimum deviation of the prism	=……………………………….Degrees  <br>
Refractive index of the material of the prism	=……………………………….  <br>
